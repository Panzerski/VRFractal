It features several generated fractals that can be explored using VR headset.

This project was made for my engineering thesis.

To be added (maybe):
- Fractal are customizable but only through inspector window for now.
- Optimalization (maybe adding LOD or an equivalent)

Notes:
- Mandelbrot, Julia and similiar fractals cause Unity to crash for unknown reasons so they are absent :(
